'''
To organize your FIFA manager project using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), we need to structure the classes, their attributes, and methods in a logical and scalable way. Below is a refined plan for your project:

--->

### **1. Core Classes and Their Responsibilities**

#### **Player Class**
- **Attributes**:
  - `name`: Name of the player.
  - `salary`: Player's salary.
  - `stats`: Dictionary or object containing player statistics (e.g., goals, assists, tackles, etc.).
  - `bio`: Player's biographical information (e.g., age, nationality, height, weight).
  - `price`: Market value or transfer price of the player.
  - `team`: The team the player currently belongs to (could be a Club or National team).
- **Methods**:
  - `update_stats()`: Updates player statistics after a match or event.
  - `transfer(new_team)`: Handles player transfer logic.

#### **Team Class (Abstract Base Class)**
- **Attributes**:
  - `name`: Name of the team.
  - `tactics`: Team's tactical setup (e.g., formation, playing style).
  - `bio`: Team's biographical information (e.g., founding year, achievements).
  - `players`: List of players in the team.
- **Methods**:
  - `add_player(player)`: Adds a player to the team.
  - `remove_player(player)`: Removes a player from the team.
  - `set_tactics(tactics)`: Updates the team's tactics.

#### **NationalTeam Class (Inherits from Team)**
- **Attributes**:
  - `candidates`: List of players eligible for selection (from intra-national tournaments).
  - `selection_method`: Criteria or process for selecting players for the national team.
- **Methods**:
  - `select_player(player)`: Selects a player from candidates to the national team.
  - `organize_tournament()`: Organizes intra-national tournaments to find new candidates.

#### **ClubTeam Class (Inherits from Team)**
- **Attributes**:
  - `funds`: Financial resources available to the club.
  - `squad`: List of players in the club's squad.
  - `transfer_budget`: Budget allocated for player transfers.
- **Methods**:
  - `purchase_player(player)`: Purchases a player from the market.
  - `sell_player(player)`: Sells a player to another team or market.
  - `manage_funds(amount)`: Updates the club's funds after transactions.

---

### **2. FIFA Management System**

#### **FIFAManager Class**
- **Attributes**:
  - `previous_records`: Database or dictionary holding all historical data (e.g., trophies, tournaments, matches) from 2000 to the current year.
  - `teams`: List of all teams (both National and Club teams).
  - `players`: List of all players in the system.
- **Methods**:
  - `hold_match(team1, team2)`: Simulates a match between two teams and updates their stats.
  - `measure_performance(player/team)`: Evaluates the performance of a player or team.
  - `update_records()`: Updates historical records after tournaments or matches.
  - `organize_tournament(teams)`: Organizes a tournament (e.g., World Cup, Champions League).

---

### **3. Transaction and Market System**

#### **Transaction Class**
- **Attributes**:
  - `market`: List of players available for transfer.
  - `transactions`: List of completed transactions (e.g., player transfers).
- **Methods**:
  - `search_player(criteria)`: Searches for players in the market based on criteria (e.g., position, price).
  - `transfer_player(player, buyer, seller)`: Handles the transfer of a player between teams.
  - `update_market()`: Updates the market with new players or changes in player status.

---

### **4. Additional Features and Enhancements**

#### **Match Simulation**
- Create a `Match` class to handle match-related logic:
  - `team1`, `team2`: The two teams playing.
  - `score`: Final score of the match.
  - `events`: List of events during the match (e.g., goals, fouls).
  - `simulate()`: Simulates the match and updates player and team stats.

#### **Tournament System**
- Create a `Tournament` class to manage tournaments:
  - `name`: Name of the tournament (e.g., World Cup, Champions League).
  - `teams`: List of participating teams.
  - `schedule`: Match schedule for the tournament.
  - `winner`: The winning team of the tournament.
  - `simulate_tournament()`: Simulates the entire tournament.

#### **User Interface (Optional)**
- If you plan to build a user interface:
  - Create a `UI` class to interact with the system.
  - Methods like `display_team()`, `display_player()`, `display_market()` can be added.

---

### **5. Relationships Between Classes**
- **Player** belongs to a **Team** (either Club or National).
- **ClubTeam** and **NationalTeam** inherit from **Team**.
- **FIFAManager** manages all teams, players, and matches.
- **Transaction** handles player transfers and market operations.
- **Match** and **Tournament** are used to simulate and manage games.

---

### **6. Data Storage**
- Use dictionaries or lists to store data in memory (for simplicity).
- Alternatively, use a database (e.g., SQLite) to store players, teams, and historical records.

---

### **7. Workflow**
1. **Initialize System**:
   - Create instances of teams, players, and the FIFA manager.
2. **Simulate Matches and Tournaments**:
   - Use the `hold_match()` and `organize_tournament()` methods.
3. **Manage Transfers**:
   - Use the `Transaction` class to buy/sell players.
4. **Evaluate Performance**:
   - Use the `measure_performance()` method to analyze players and teams.
5. **Update Records**:
   - Use the `update_records()` method to maintain historical data.
